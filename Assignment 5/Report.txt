1. Structures for Page Table (containing page nuber and valid bit), free frame list (containing frame number), and message queues are made.

2. Master first generates unique keys and attaches to the different IPC shared memories and message queues. It then initializes the respective memory elements.

3. Master calls execvp to scheduler, process and MMU and passes the requiered arguments.

4. Generates page reference string for each process and passes them as argument to each process.

5. In the scheduler, if nothing is being read from the ready queue and all processes have been completed, then send a signal to Master saying the processes is complete.

6. Scheduler sends a signal to process for waking it up in FCFS manner.

7. Take necessary actions regarding the message passed by MMU to scheduler (PAGE_FAULT_HANDLED or TERMINATED).

8. Each process on waking up, sees the page reference string and demands for pages in order.

9. If the MMU sends a valid frame number, it then continues and demands for the next page.

10. If MMU sends -1, then pause the process.

11. If the MMU is started and receives a valid page request from the process, it returns the corresponding frame number or -1 if the frame is not available in the frame is not free.

12. If no free frame is available, sends -1 to the process and loads a frame from disk in the main memory, by replacing the vicitim page.

13. After loading the requested frame, it then sends PAGE_FAULT_HANDLED to scheduler and waits for the next request to handle.
