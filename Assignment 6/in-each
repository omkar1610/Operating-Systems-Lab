inside each function maintain local variables
int inodeno //jobhi inode we are working on
int currentdatablockno//initialize to dp[0] wala block no
int currentdatablockoffset//initially 0
int indirectiontype//initially 0
int directoffset//initially 0
int sipblockoffset//initially 0
int dipblockoffset1//initially 0
int dipblockoffset2 //initially 0

after this dont touch these variables. Just ask the function getpointertonextentry to change them. Agar block no and block offset pata hai to all access is trivial.
