This is a report regarding the strategy we used to create and schedule the producer and the consumer threads.

1. Created P number of PRODUCER threads and C number of CONSUMER threads from a total of N threads with equal probability using rand() function.

2. Created SHCEDULER and REPORTER threads.

3. In the Producer function, check if the thread is alive. If yes, chekc if it has already generated 1000 random numbers. If yes, set the status of the thread as dead. If the thread is sleeping, wait, else generate a random number and store in the buffer. Also, increment the numbers it generated by 1.

4. In the Consumer thread, check if the thread is alive. If yes, check if the buffer is empty and there are no producer left (this imples that the consumer has nothing to do). If yes, set the status of the consumer as dead. If the thread is sleeping, wait, else remove a number from the buffer.

5. The Scheduler thread shcedules the producer and the consumer threads in a round robin fashion nad instructs the thread to sleep and wake accordingly. Exits if no producer or consumer threads are alive.

6. The Reporter thread prints the status of all the threads and the number of elements in the buffer. Exits if no producer or consumer threads are alive.
